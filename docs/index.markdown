Currently I'm a Knowledge Engineering BS-MS student at [The VNUHCM - University of Science](https://en.hcmus.edu.vn), batch of 2019, majoring in **Natural Language Processing** and working on my graduation thesis from August 2022 [(see below)](#text-correction--suggestion). 

I'm planned to graduate and receive my BSc. degree in 2023, then continue pursuing my MSc. in Computer Science, still focusing on **Natural Language Processing**.

## Publifications
TBD

## Research Interests
My research topics in Natural Language Processing include:

### Optical Character Recognition
I built an character-level OCR pipeline for Vietnamese Ancient Text (Chu Nom), using CenterNet for segmentation and simple character classification for recognition. 

Resources: 
- [GitHub repository for my work](https://github.com/trhgquan/OCR_chu_Nom), Spring 2022.

### Text Classification
Mostly Sentiment Analysis and several other Text Classification tasks.

Resources:
- [GitHub repository for a Fakenews Detection](https://github.com/trhgquan/fakenews-detection), Spring 2022.

### Semantic Textual Similarity
Mostly Sentence Paraphrase Detection.

Resources:
- [GitHub repository for a Sentence Similarity detector](https://github.com/trhgquan/sbert-sentence-similarity), Spring 2022.

### Text Correction & Suggestion
We build an Address Correction and Suggestion engine, using simple GRU Seq2Seq and Attention mechanism.

Resources:
- [Address Correction based on Machine Learning - BSc. Graduation thesis](/address-correction-with-ml), Spring 2023

### Other topics
Beside Natural Language Processing, I'm interested in:
- **Cryptography**: currently I'm maintaining a repository (in Vietnamese) for Introduction to Cryptography (CSC15005) and Applied Cryptography (CSC15003) course materials (code, course summarise). Checkout the repository [here](https://github.com/trhgquan/crypto). Also, there is an online version [here](https://trhgquan.github.io/crypto).
- **Mathematics**: Mathematical Analysis, Number Theory and Abstract Algebra.

## Tech
- **Coding**: C/C++, Python (Flask, Django), PHP (Laravel), JavaScript (vanilla), Perl.
- **Scripting**: Bash, AutoIt, Makefile.
- **ML/DL**: TensorFlow, torch, trax, scikit-learn.
- **Misc**: Markdown, LaTeX  and vanilla vim (my configurations are [here](https://github.com/hwangswan/dotfiles)).
