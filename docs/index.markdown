Currently I'm a Knowledge Engineering BS-MS student at [The VNUHCM - University of Science](https://en.hcmus.edu.vn), batch of 2019, majoring in **Natural Language Processing** and working on my graduation thesis from August 2022.

I'm planned to graduate and receive my BSc. degree in 2023, then continue pursuing my MSc. in Computer Science, still focusing on **Natural Language Processing**.

Feel free to send me an email: *quan* (at) *trhgquan* (dot) *xyz*

## Research Interests
### Natural Language Processing
My research topics in Natural Language Processing include:
- Text Classification
- Semantic Textual Similarity
- Grammartical Error Correction
- Optical Character Recognition (related)

### Other topics
Beside Natural Language Processing, I'm interested in:
- **Cryptography**: I'm maintaining a repository (in Vietnamese) for Introduction to Cryptography (CSC15005) and Applied Cryptography (CSC15003) course materials (code, course summarise). Checkout the repository [here](https://github.com/trhgquan/crypto) and its online version [here](https://trhgquan.github.io/crypto).
- **Mathematics**: Mathematical Analysis, Number Theory and Abstract Algebra.

## Publications
TBD

## Tech
- **Coding**: C/C++, Python (Flask, Django), PHP (Laravel), JavaScript (vanilla), Perl.
- **Scripting**: Bash, AutoIt, Makefile.
- **ML/DL**: TensorFlow, torch, trax, scikit-learn.
- **Misc**: Markdown, LaTeX (view my templates [here](https://github.com/khongsomeo/latex-products))  and vanilla vim (my configurations are [here](https://github.com/hwangswan/dotfiles)).
